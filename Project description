Childcare Center Compliance in NYC – Capstone Project 

## Overview
This project investigates **compliance patterns in NYC childcare centers** using inspection data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). The goal is to understand the **drivers behind violation rates**, build **predictive models** to anticipate compliance failures, and offer **policy-relevant insights** for improving child safety and regulatory efficiency.

## Research Questions
1. What is the distribution of violation rates across NYC boroughs?
2. How do program types (e.g., Preschool vs. Infant/Toddler) affect violations?
3. What are the historical trends in critical and public health hazard violations?
4. Does maximum center capacity correlate with violation rates?
5. Can we predict critical violations using operational and demographic features?

## Dataset
* Source: [NYC Open Data – DOHMH Childcare Center Inspections](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Childcare-Center-Inspections/dsg6-ifza)
* 27,000+ inspection records across 3 years
* Key variables: Violation rates, program type, borough, capacity, staff count, violation type

## Data Processing
* Removed missing and low-utility columns
* Imputed missing values using median/mode
* Feature engineering:

  * Binary flags for critical violations
  * Center age derived from inspection and permit dates
  * Large center flag (capacity > 100)

## Modeling & Results
### ➤ Violation Rate Insights
* Bronx has the **highest and most variable** violation rates.
* Preschool programs showed **better compliance**; Infant/Toddler centers had higher risks.
### ➤ Linear & Random Forest Regression
* Max capacity alone poorly predicted violations (R² ≈ 0.006).
* Combined features (borough, program type, etc.) boosted performance (R² ≈ 0.53 with Random Forest).
### ➤ Random Forest Classification
* **97% accuracy** in predicting critical violations
* Most influential features: Borough, childcare type, historical violations, facility characteristics

## Visualizations
Created interactive plots and dashboards (e.g., boxplots, violin plots, bar charts) using:
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `sklearn` for model training and evaluation

## Conclusion
Childcare compliance varies widely by borough and program type. Predictive modeling shows strong potential for proactive inspections. Data-driven policy can enhance oversight efficiency and safety in NYC childcare centers.

## Future Work
* Include seasonal and neighborhood-level data
* Add staff training/certification features
* Explore deep learning (e.g., neural networks) and time series forecasting
